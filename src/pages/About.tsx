              When we focus on slowing down and really seeing our dogs, it brings together people from all different training backgrounds around something we all care about. This approach is simple: slow down, pay attention to your dog, and focus on building connection through understanding. It's something any individual can learn, no matter where they're starting from or coming from.

              Cher (Street Wise Canine) and Jessica (Pet Intel) may approach training differently ‚Äî one grounded in LIMA, one working within the CAPDT STOP list ‚Äî yet both agree that decompression provides common ground. It's a controversy-free zone, where we can set aside debates and focus on giving dogs (and their people) what they truly need: space to breathe, reset, and reconnect.
